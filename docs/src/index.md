# Statistics

```@meta
DocTestSetup = :(using Statistics)
```

The Statistics module contains basic statistics functionality: mean, median, quantiles,
standard deviation, variance, skewness, kurtosis, correlation and covariance.
Statistics can be weighted, and several weights types are distinguished to apply appropriate
corrections where necessary.
